### Project 1: [Unlocking HR Performance: A Data-Driven Exploration of Employee Metrics](https://github.com/egaruba/Human-Resources-Analytics-Dashboard)
The Human Resources Department is responsible for monitoring and managing various aspects of employee data to ensure the organisation maintains a healthy workforce. However, there is a lack of clear performance indicators to track and analyse key departmental metrics. This employee data analysis project aims to provide insights into the lack of clear trackable performance metrics for the Human Resources Department. By analysing various aspects of the employee data, I hope to identify trends, make data-driven recommendations and gain a deeper understanding of the Human Resources Department’s key performance metrics.
